                    <div class="spokad_desc">
                        In 2005, the Presidium of the St. Petersburg United Bar Association (SPUBA) initiated the
                        adoption of a decision to start registering SPUBA branches in the CIS countries and the former
                        USSR with a view to extend and introduce the Bar to the area of international relations to
                        provide legal counsel to persons under the legal jurisdiction of the former USSR countries,
                        though having interests in the Russian Federation. Another goal was to represent and protect the
                        interests of Russian nationals abroad, develop foreign relations of the Bar and boost its image
                        in the foreign market of legal support. With this in view, in the same year in September,Tbilisi
                        witnessed the official registration of the Branch (Office) of the St. Petersburg United Bar
                        Association in Georgia.<br><br>The main tasks of the Branch, officially approved by Georgian
                        authorities, were representing and protecting the interests of Russian principals over a wide
                        spectrum of issues, including those presented to state administration bodies, local
                        administration bodies, public associations and other organisations in Georgia, and representing
                        the interest of Georgian principals on various issues in Russia. The Branch, not being a legal
                        entity, enjoys the rights to and bears the obligations of the Bar Association according to the
                        Federal Law "On Legal Practice and Advocacy in the Russian Federation", the Federal Law "On
                        Non-commercial Organisations", the Bar Association Charter, the "Provisions on the SPUBA Branch
                        in Georgia", and generally recognised principles and norms of international law and
                        international agreements. The Branch was set up without any limitations on its term of
                        activity.<br><br>Georgii Chochua, lawyer and member of the Presidium and Deputy President of
                        SPUBA for the Central Federal District of the RF, was assigned governance of the activities of
                        foreign SPUBA branches and offices, including those in Georgia.<br><br>The scope of legal advice
                        offered by the Branch of the St. Petersburg United Bar Association in Georgia enables building
                        on the vast legal opportunities embodied in the legislation of the Russian Federation in Georgia
                        to resolve economic, property and other legal disputes among the residents of both
                        countries.<br>
