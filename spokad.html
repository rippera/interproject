                        On 8 April 1990, forty practicing lawyers in Leningrad and the Leningrad Region founded,
                        pursuant to Article 3 of the Law of the USSR "On Advocacy in the USSR", the Leningrad United Bar
                        Association as a voluntary inter-territorial association of legal professionals practicing in
                        protecting the rights of citizens, the legal interests of organisations, and in legal
                        representation. The Bar Association was the first alternative (concurrent) circle of legal
                        professionals in the Soviet Union.<br><br>On 20 August of the same year, the Bar Association was
                        registered with and approved by decision of the executive committee of the Leningrad Municipal
                        Council of People's Deputies (decision No. 701). Yu.A. Ilyin was elected Chairman of the
                        Bar.<br><br>In September 1991, the name of the city of Leningrad was restored its historical one
                        – St. Petersburg – and the Bar Association was renamed to the St. Petersburg United Bar
                        Association.<br><br>Presently, the Bar Association members are 390 legal professionals,
                        including five Doc. Legal Sci., four PhDs in legal sciences, eight instructors at higher
                        education establishments, one Honoured Lawyer of Russia, sixty-two Honorary Attorneys at Law of
                        Russia, and fourteen Honoured members of the Bar Association. One person was awarded the Plevako
                        Gold Medal; another one, the Plevako silver Medal; fifty-two persons were awarded the Silver
                        Badge of the Bar Association. One lawyer of the Bar Association is member of the International
                        Bar Association.<br><br>The Bar Association was originally created as a union of lawyers from
                        different Russian regions, including remote ones. That is the reason why it bears the name
                        "United".<br><br>Presently, the Bar Association includes sixty-three law offices (branches) in
                        the constituent entities of the Federation (regions). Bar associations are present in the
                        following cities and towns: Archangel, Babaevo, Yekaterinburg, Kazan, Kaluga, Kandalaksha,
                        Krasnodar, Moscow and the Moscow Region, Novosibirsk, St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region
                        (including Luga, Podporozhie, Sestroretsk, and Sosnovyi Bor). From the outset, this helped
                        address clients' problems without delay and resorting to prolonged negotiations with other
                        lawyer unions. The constituent entities of the Russian Federation meet the demand in
                        professional legal services much better by following St. Petersburg standards.<br><br>The Bar
                        Association is the founder of the Council of Lawyers of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region
                        that revived the traditions of the pre-October 1917 Revolution Council of Attorneys at Law in
                        St. Petersburg.<br><br>The Bar Association, based on the principle of unity and collaboration of
                        lawyers, managed to establish business contacts with many Russian unions of lawyers and the
                        international legal community, including lawyers and barristers in Great Britain, Germany, The
                        Netherlands, the USA and Finland.<br><br>Special relations have connected the Bar Association
                        with the International Bar Association (IBA) — the most prestigious, esteemed and sizeable
                        organisation of lawyers worldwide.<br><br>The Bar Association was among the founders of the Bar
                        Association of Russia, the Federal Union of Lawyers and the Guild of Russian Lawyers, and takes
                        part in the activities of the Federal Chamber of Lawyers of the Russian Federation and the St.
                        Petersburg Advocates' Chamber. <br>
